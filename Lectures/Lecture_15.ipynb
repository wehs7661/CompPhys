    "For systems of particles with short-range interactions, the potential energy, forces, and other properties can be calculated in a straightforward and efficient way using the methods described previously, using the minimum-image convention (for periodic systems) or spherical truncation of interactions (in general). Approximate long-range corrections to the potential energy and pressure may also be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation is more complicated in systems with *long-range* interactions that fall off with distance $r$ no faster than $\\sim r^{-d}$, where $d$ is the spatial dimensionality. Important examples include systems of particles with Coulombic, dipolar, or gravitational interactions. In such systems, simple truncation of pair interactions leads to highly inaccurate results, and calculating all pairwise interactions without truncation in a brute force fashion entails $O(N^2)$ computational cost in a system of $N$ particles, and yields ill-defined properties in systems with periodic boundary conditions."

    "A variety of methods have been developed to deal with these issues, including the *Ewald summation method* for computing electrostatic interactions in periodic systems of charged particles, in which a conditionally convergent sum over a periodic array of unit cells is replaced by two rapidly convergent sums, one in real space and the other in Fourier space. When optimized with respect to a free convergence parameter, the computational cost of the Ewald summation method scales as $O(N^{3/2})$.\n",

    "For large $N$, even better scaling can be achieved with *grid-based methods* such as the smooth particle mesh Ewald (SPME) and particle-particle particle-mesh (PPPM) methods, in which the real-space charge density is mapped onto a regular grid, enabling use of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to compute the Fourier-space part of the Ewald sum. The computational complexity of these methods is that of the FFT algorithm, $O(N \\ln N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, multiscale methods such as the *fast multipole method* (FMM) achieve $O(N)$ scaling, albeit at the cost of additional algorithmic complexity, and are the fastest methods for simulating very large systems. Unlike Ewald-based methods, the FFM method is easily adapted to non-periodic systems, which makes it an attractive method for cosmological and fluid dynamics simulations (but the PPPM method is also an attractive option)."
