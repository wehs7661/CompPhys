    "The most time-consuming part of most MC and MD simulations is the energy or force calculation. In a system of $N$ particles with pairwise-additive interaction potentials, this would appear to involve computing $O(N^2)$ pair interactions. However, for systems with *short-range* interactions, it's possible to do substantially better than this by using an interaction cutoff and employing *neighbor lists* (sometimes called *Verlet lists*) or *cell lists*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of computing short-range interactions is $O(N)$ using cell lists and $\\sim O(N^{3/2})$ using neighbor lists, so cell lists are always advantageous for large $N$, but neighbor lists may perform better for intermediate values of $N$, and an *all-pairs* neighbor search may be faster for small $N$. It's also possible to combine neighbor lists and cell lists to obtain a method that outperforms either method separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "For periodic systems with *long-range* interactions, the Ewald summation method can be used to reduce the computational complexity to $O(N^{3/2})$, and FFT-based variations of the Ewald method such as particle-mesh Ewald (PME) and particle-particle particle-mesh (P$^3$M) can further reduce the computational cost to $O(N \\ln N)$. There are also $O(N)$ methods such as the fast multipole (FMM) method."
