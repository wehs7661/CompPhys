    "Because Hamiltonian dynamics conserves energy, the natural thermodynamic ensemble for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is the $NVE$ ensemble. In many cases it is more useful to conduct simulations in other ensembles ($NVT$ or $NPT$), as these ensembles correspond to the typical experimental conditions, and may be more convenient for calculating certain quantities (e.g., free energies and phase diagrams).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will focus on methods for carrying out MD simulations at constant temperature $T$, in the $NVT$ ensemble. Methods for maintaining constant pressure in MD simulations will be discussed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing specific constant-$T$ MD methods, it's useful to consider what we are really trying to simulate when we carry out an MD simulation (or any statistical mechanical simulation for that matter). Quite generally, we can regard an MD simulation of a system of $N$ particles with periodic boundary conditions as a model of a small *subsystem* within a much larger, macroscopic system, in which the remainder of the macroscopic system acts as a thermal reservoir (heat bath) that maintains the subsystem at a constant *average* temperature $T$. The macroscopic reservoir may also exchange volume and particles with the subsystem to maintain constant pressure $P$ and chemical potential $\\mu$, but for now we will only consider exchange of *energy* between the subsystem and the reservoir."

These stochastic interactions with the heat bath can be regarded as Monte Carlo moves that transport the system from one constant-energy shell to another. The method proposed by Andersen (the *Andersen thermostat*) is an example of a stochastic thermostat that we'll discuss shortly. *Langevin dynamics* is another stochastic dynamics method that we'll discuss later in the semester.\n",

The most commonly used extended Lagrangian method is the so-called *Nose-Hoover thermostat* (and the related Nose-Hoover chain algorithm), which will be described in more detail below. Integration schemes for such extended Lagrangians can be derived via the same operator-splitting methods that we used to derive the velocity Verlet integrator.\n",
