    "Hamiltonian dynamics is built starting with the Lagrangian function $L({\\bf q},\\dot{\\bf q})$, where ${\\bf q}$ and $\\dot{\\bf q}$ are a set of *generalized* coordinates and velocities (e.g., they could represent angles or normal mode amplitudes and their corresponding time derivatives). The Lagrangian is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy $K$ and the potential energy $U$, $$L({\\bf q},\\dot{\\bf q}) = K({\\bf q},\\dot{\\bf q}) - U({\\bf q},\\dot{\\bf q}).$$ In general, $K$ and $U$ are functions of both generalized coordinates and velocities, but in most cases of interest to us we will have $L({\\bf q},\\dot{\\bf q}) = K(\\dot{\\bf q}) - U({\\bf q})$, a fact that greatly simplifies the formulation of classical statistical mechanics."

    "Finite-difference methods are one of the standard approaches to solving ordinary differential equations such as Hamilton's equations of motion, and are the methods most commonly used in molecular dynamics. This approach involves approximating the exact *continuous-time* time evolution of a dynamical system by a *discrete-time* dynamics, in which we estimate the particle positions and velocities (or momenta) at time $t + \\Delta t$ from their values at time $t$ using a finite-difference approximation. Here $\\Delta t$ is a finite time interval that is typically small compared to the fastest characteristic timescale for the system of interest (e.g., the period of oscillation of a harmonic oscillator)."
