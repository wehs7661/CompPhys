    "In the second homework assignment, you wrote a simple molecular dynamics (MD) simulation program for the 3D Lennard-Jones (LJ) system, using the minimum-image convention. In this tutorial, you'll modify your MD simulation code to implement a truncated and shifted LJ potential. Imposing a spherical cutoff can lead to significant speedups in the execution of MD (or MC) code, when used in conjunction with fast neighbor-search methods such as cell lists and/or Verlet neighbor lists.\n",

    "In the previous tutorial, we investigated the effects of truncation on energy conservation in an MD simulation of a system of interaction particles in a central force potential. To achieve improved energy conservation in MD simulations, it's common to shift the pair potential $u(r_{ij})$ so that it's continuous at the cutoff distance $r_c$:\n",
