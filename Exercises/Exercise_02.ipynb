    "## E2.1 - Neighbor lists and cell lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will implement the neighbor list and cell list methods for speeding up force/energy calculations in an MD simulation of the two-dimensional (2D) Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model with periodic boundary conditions, and will compare the performance of these algorithms with an all-pairs ($O(N^2)$) neighbor search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the WCA potential is just the Lennard-Jones potential truncated at the minimum ($r_c = 2^{1/6} \\sigma$) and shifted so that the potential is continuous at the cutoff distance. In the WCA model, no long-range corrections to the potential energy or pressure (or other thermodynamic properties) are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, write an MD simulation program for the 2D WCA model with periodic boundary conditions, using the velocity Verlet algorithm, and using an all-pairs search to compute pair interactions. Verify that the program works correctly, with stable dynamics (e.g., good energy conservation). If possible, compare the average potential energy per particle and pressure measured in your simulation with literature values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, implement the Verlet neighbor list method, with the neighbor list skin $\\delta = r_l - r_c$ as an additional parameter that can be varied to optimize the performance of the algorithm. Note that the neighbor list cutoff $r_l$ cannot exceed half the linear dimension of the simulation box (i.e., you should make sure that $r_l \\leq L/2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Verify that using neighbor lists gives identical results to the all-pairs neighbor search, given the same initial conditions, at least for several hundred timesteps. If you see a discrepancy, this probably means that there's a mistake in your neighbor list implementation. Use the method discussed in class and in Allen & Tildesley to determine when to update the neighbor list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Measure the speedup of the neighbor list method relative to the all pairs method for various values of $\\delta$ and $N$ (the number of particles).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, implement the cell search method, and repeat the steps outlined above for the neighbor list method.\n"
